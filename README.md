# Hello World!

I'm **Matthew**, based in Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©.
I specialize in backend development, however one of the things that I'm good at is adjusting myself to different tech stacks and workflows.
I value delivering high quality, reliable, and efficient software as my highest principle in developing software, and I take pride of that.
Most of my initiatives at work are to reduce redundant and inefficient work and make ensuring releases done easier, faster, and more reliable.

I'm open for opportunities from all over the world, and I'm willing to adjust my working hours to match your core hours. My timezone is UTC+7.
